// Q # 24 More Conditional Tests:

              //TASK 1
//Tests for equality and inequality with strings 

let country = "Pakistan"
console.log("is country is equal to 'Pakistan'?.")
console.log(country === "Pakistan") // true

let city = "Karachi"
console.log("\nis city is not equal to 'Karachi'?.")
console.log(city != "Karachi") //false

                 //TASK 2
//Tests using the lower case function

let book ="ENGLISH"
console.log("\n is English  is equal to english after written in 'lowercase'?")
console.log(book.toLowerCase() === "english")//true

let bike = "HONDA"
console.log("\nis honda is not equal to honda after converting in 'lowercase'?")
console.log(bike.toLowerCase() != "honda")// false 

              //TASK 3
//Numerical tests involving equality and inequality,  
//greater than and less than, greater than or equal to, and less than or equal to
 

// variable define
let num1 =10;
